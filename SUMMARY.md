# Atlanta Housing ABM — Project Summary

A quick-orientation document: what this model is, what's been done to it, and
where things currently stand. For full technical detail on any item below,
see `docs/methodology.md` (the complete defect-by-defect and
finding-by-finding narrative this summary is drawn from).

## What this is

A Mesa-based agent-based model of the Atlanta, GA housing market, adapted
from Baptista et al. 2016 (Bank of England Staff Working Paper 619, whose
reference Java implementation is at
[INET-Complexity/housing-model](https://github.com/INET-Complexity/housing-model)).
Renters, first-time buyers, repeat buyers, small landlords, and institutional
investors trade in a single-tract market. The model evaluates six
institutional-investor restriction policies (waiting period, soft/hard
ownership caps, purchase tax, vacancy tax, progressive portfolio tax) against
homeownership rate, rental vacancy, price appreciation, and first-time-buyer
purchase share. The accompanying paper is at `paper/main.tex`.

**Repo note:** this session pushes to `anirudhvt/housing-abm-expansion` only,
not `anirudhvt/housing-abm` — the two may diverge; treat `-expansion` as the
current one.

## Status at a glance

- **7/7 validation targets met** at the paired-comparison spin-up/window
  (down from an original 2/5), after the bug-fixing and stationarity work
  below.
- **Two of the paper's original headline conclusions reverse** under the
  corrected model (waiting period, hard ownership cap — see below).
- **The price-formation mechanism was rewritten mid-session** (EMA +
  reversion port from the Java reference) to fix a runaway bubble at
  N=300 households; the delivered policy results in `results/` predate
  that fix and have **not yet been re-run** on the corrected model — the
  single highest-priority open item.
- **Extensive real-data grounding work** (HMDA, Zillow, Fannie Mae loan
  performance, SCF) has been layered on since, documented in
  `docs/methodology.md` Sections 9-12.

## Phase 1 — Fixing the original wide-confidence-interval problem

The starting complaint: paired policy effects had confidence intervals wide
enough to cross zero on almost every outcome. Diagnosed as three compounding
problems, in order of impact:

1. **Model bugs that severed the channels the policies act through** — seven
   found, three of which made specific policies incapable of any measurable
   effect: resale listings never actually reaching the sale market
   (`queue_listing` bug, 79% of repeat buyers stuck), an investor buy/sell
   logistic saturated at P=1.0 from an annual/monthly unit mismatch (EQ9/12),
   and a paired-experiment design that didn't actually pair (two independent
   models per seed instead of a shared spin-up forked into arms — arm
   correlation was ~0, sometimes negative). Also: purchase tax mis-charged,
   vacancy tax grace period off by a unit (months vs. days), portfolio tax
   brackets set far above the realized portfolio distribution, and the
   waiting period restricting twice as many agent classes as the other five
   policies.
2. **An experiment design that discarded information** — rebuilt around a
   shared spin-up per seed forked into baseline/policy arms, split RNG
   substreams for exogenous processes, window-averaged outcomes instead of a
   single-month snapshot, Holm-Bonferroni correction across the full
   policy x outcome grid, bootstrap CIs alongside normal-theory ones, and
   minimum-detectable-effect reporting.
3. **A baseline that hadn't reached demographic/population stationarity** —
   wrong initial age distribution (uniform instead of the mortality-implied
   steady state), an uncompensated population sink from rent-burden exits,
   no capital outflow for institutional investors (added a REIT-style payout
   ratio), and a zero rental-vacancy floor from instant re-letting (added a
   1-month frictional void).

Also added: an income-qualification gate on the renter→first-time-buyer
transition (previously savings-only) and listing withdrawal after 6 months
on market (nothing previously took a stale listing off the market, which had
deadlocked ~20% of repeat buyers and run inventory to ~108 months).

**Result:** median CI width 7.4x tighter, mean arm correlation 0.22 → 0.71,
tests surviving Holm correction 0 → 10 (of 30), validation targets 2/5 → 7/7.
Two conclusions reversed: the **waiting period** (the paper's headline
recommendation, originally +3.3% homeownership) now measures **-2.1%** —
excluded from fresh listings, investors buy discounted stale inventory
instead, where the same capital buys more homes. The **hard ownership cap**
does suppress institutional purchases and is the only policy that raises
homeownership (+0.82%), but the diverted purchases go mostly to **small
landlords**, not first-time buyers. The null result on all three financial
penalties (purchase/vacancy/portfolio tax) is now a real, informative bound
rather than an artifact of a broken mechanism.

## Phase 2 — Price-formation port (mid-session rewrite)

Implementing the paper's mechanisms as closely as possible surfaced a new
problem: at N=300 households, price ran to ~29x median income within 15
years (vs. ~7.6x at N=900) — a reflexive bubble specific to thin markets.
Root cause: the tract's price was a raw overwrite from each month's sales
median, and next month's appreciation signal (EQ4) was computed from that
same series, so noise compounded through the demand-appreciation feedback
loop.

**Fix:** ported the reference Java model's two-stage price formation
(`HousingMarketStats.postClearingRecord()`) — an EMA blend of realized
sales into the smoothed price, plus a reversion term pulling back toward a
calibrated reference level (the 2019 Atlanta ZHVI/ZORI mean, which happened
to already be sitting unused in the repo and matches the paper's own cited
figures almost exactly). A further bug specific to this model's single
continuous-quality tract (no quality bins to pool sales across, unlike the
reference) required also EMA-smoothing the house-price-index itself, not
just the price level — caught via a runaway-price test before shipping.
12 new tests pin the two-stage arithmetic.

**Not yet done:** the full 60-seed policy study has not been re-run since
this fix. The results in `results/` predate it.

## Phase 3 — Grounding the model in real data ("the calibration work")

Triggered by: "I want to ground the model and refine it... how do we
calibrate it as close as possible to how the reference calibrated theirs?"
The reference's own pattern (visible in its
`src/main/resources/calibration-code/*.py`): pull real microdata → build a
weighted empirical distribution → feed it into the model, for nearly every
parameter. A full tiered roadmap of US data-source equivalents was built
first (published as an artifact), then worked through in order:

**Already-downloaded data, just not fully used (fixed):**
- `pull_zillow_data.py` was mislabeled — claimed to pull ZHVI (home prices)
  but its URL/output was actually ZORI (rents); now pulls and labels both
  correctly.
- `use_external_appreciation_data` was a config flag read nowhere — the full
  2015-2026 ZHVI/ZORI history sat unused beyond a single 2019 mean. Now
  actually wires the real series into the model's appreciation signal when
  enabled (off by default — a real modeling choice, not a bug fix).
- `pyproject.toml` was missing `requests` as a dependency despite
  `pull_hmda_data.py` needing it — surfaced when re-running that pull
  locally.
- `pull_hmda_data.py`'s `pull_year()` silently dropped any requested field
  not present in the API response (including `applicant_age` on first
  attempt, and a `combined_loan_to_value_ratio` that had *never* existed in
  the live API) — now warns loudly instead of failing silently.

**Down-payment calibration (EQ17), in two passes:**
- First pass: fit against real Atlanta HMDA data using loan type (FHA vs.
  conventional) as a proxy for first-time vs. repeat buyer, since HMDA
  carries no direct first-time-buyer flag.
- Second pass: replaced the proxy with **Fannie Mae's Single-Family Loan
  Performance Data**, which has a genuine `First Time Home Buyer Indicator`.
  The real flag *reversed* the proxy's main claim — only 33.5% of actual
  first-time buyers sit at the down-payment floor (the proxy said 85%,
  *above* the model's own 55% assumption, not below).
- A rigorous paired before/after comparison (60 seeds, same CRN design as
  the policy study) showed adopting either fit moves modeled leverage
  (LTV/LTI) but not homeownership or purchase-share outcomes — **not
  adopted into config**, left as a documented finding.

**Age-conditioned LTV/LTI (attempted, then deliberately not wired in):**
- Fit a real regression (`LTV ~ log(income) + age`) from HMDA's
  `applicant_age` field: mean LTV declines monotonically from 92.6% (<25)
  to 83.6% (75+), a genuine effect net of income.
- Investigated how the reference model actually uses its equivalent
  (`decideLTV()`) before designing how to wire this in — and found it's
  **dead code**: the only call site is commented out in the reference's own
  `Household.java`, under the original authors' own TODO ("decision needed
  between this and previous specification"). The paper's actual results
  never depended on age at all. Decision: leave this as a documented
  finding rather than build a competing LTV-cap mechanism into the model.

**Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), the US analogue of the reference's
single richest source (UK's Wealth and Assets Survey):**
- Fit age distribution, income-given-age, EQ1's wealth-given-income
  relationship, and investor propensity by income decile, all from one
  2022 SCF extract.
- Investor propensity was the standout: a real, monotonic ~20x gradient
  (3% of the bottom income decile owns a second residential property,
  60% of the top decile) that the model had zero equivalent for. Checked
  precedent first (learned from the decideLTV surprise) — the reference's
  equivalent (`BTLProbability.getBinAt(incomePercentile)`) *is* genuinely
  live in every household's constructor, not commented out.
- **This one was wired in**: small-landlord selection now draws incomes
  from the same household distribution as everyone else, then selects
  without replacement weighted by the real SCF curve — replacing a
  disconnected, unexplained "landlords skew higher-income" lognormal.
  Verified with 8 new unit tests, a smoke-run income comparison, and a
  before/after `validate_against_paper.py` run (via `git stash`) to isolate
  this change's effect from everything else — 5/7 targets both times,
  identical pre-existing failures both times, investor-share calibration
  undisturbed.

## What's still open

Roughly in priority order:

1. **Re-run the full 60-seed policy study** on the post-price-formation-fix
   model. Everything reported in Phase 1's results predates that fix.
2. **Rewrite `paper/main.tex` Sections 5-7** to match the corrected results
   — still arguing the original (reversed) conclusions.
3. **A residual +3%/yr appreciation drift**, population-invariant, left as
   an open judgment call (strengthen the price-reversion constant, or
   revisit EQ3's own beta calibration) — not yet decided.
4. **Rental vacancy trending low** as N grows — an older, separate,
   unrelated finding.
5. **Remaining calibration roadmap steps** (see `docs/methodology.md`
   Section 9's tiered plan): SSA/CDC life tables + American Housing Survey
   tenure data (step 3), checking what county GIS/assessor portals expose
   before deciding on ZTRAX (step 4), and the two structural SCF findings
   not yet wired in — age distribution and income-given-age both replacing
   an analytic/flat approximation with a real empirical target, and EQ1's
   wealth-given-income dispersion finding once its income-unit mismatch
   (SCF annual vs. the model's monthly) is reconciled.
