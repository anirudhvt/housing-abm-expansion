"""Small-landlord selection weighted by real income-percentile propensity.

Grounded in the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (docs/methodology.md
Section 11, scripts/calibrate_scf.py): P(household owns other residential
real estate) rises monotonically from ~3% at the bottom income decile to
~60% at the top -- the direct US analogue of the reference Java model's
WAS-derived BTL propensity curve. Unlike decideLTV (Section 10c), the
reference's equivalent mechanism is genuinely live:
BTLProbability.getBinAt(incomePercentile) runs in every household's
constructor in HouseholdBehaviour.java, not commented out.

Institutional investors are out of scope for this module -- SCF surveys
individual households, not LLCs/funds, so it can only ground "mom and pop"
landlord selection (SmallLandlord), not institutional counts.

This replaces the previous mechanism -- landlord income drawn from its own
disconnected, hand-picked lognormal ("landlords skew higher-income than
renters") -- with landlord incomes drawn from the same household income
distribution as everyone else, then *selected* with probability weighted
by the real income-percentile curve. The realistic income skew now falls
out of who gets selected, rather than being assumed as a separate
distribution.
